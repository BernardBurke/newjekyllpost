# newjekyllpost
A shell script to create a Jekyll post from a 'template' - focus is on mediumish theme

As a newb in jekyll land, I thought the concept of writing up your blog posts as stylised markdown is a great idea for me.

I really expected to find some tools for knocking out a post quickly... rolled my own for now.

Could easily be adapted as a blog loader/converter.
